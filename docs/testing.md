# How to help test the CLR.fund app

## What you'll need
1. Arbitrum Goerlie ETH
  - Get Goerlie ETH from [Unitap](https://unitap.app/gas-tap)
  - Use the [bridge](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/?l2ChainId=421613) to convert to Arbitrum Goerli ETH

2. Test DAI tokens

  The test DAI tokens can be minted from the [etherscan contract page](https://goerli.arbiscan.io//address/0x65bc8dd04808d99cf8aa6749f128d55c2051edde#writeContract) with the follow inputs:
  
  - usr (address): Your wallet address
  - wad (uint256): How many DAI tokens to mint, e.g. 20000000000000000000 is 20 DAI
